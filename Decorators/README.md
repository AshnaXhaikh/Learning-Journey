# 📍 Part 1: Functions are Objects in Python

In Python, functions are **first-class objects**. That means:

✅ You can:
- Assign them to variables
- Pass them to other functions
- Return them from functions

### 💡 Why this matters
This concept is the **foundation** for understanding decorators. Decorators are built on the idea of returning and wrapping functions.
